  holoportation is a new type of 3D capture technology that allows high quality
  3D models of people to be reconstructed, compressed, and transmitted anywhere
  in the world in real-time. When combined with mixed reality displays such as
  HoloLens, this technology allows users to see and interact with remote
  participants in 3D as if they are actually present in their physical space.
